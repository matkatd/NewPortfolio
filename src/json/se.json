      "<p>The purpose of the project was to teach us about relational databases, propositional logic, discrete structures such as graphs, and writing large programs</p>",
      "<p>The program would take two command line argurments: an input file with DataLog code, and a file to write to. Next, the program took the input, tokenized it, parsed it, and performed operations on the database. The final part of the project was using graphs and depth first search to optimize the order in which the database operations were performed.</p>"
